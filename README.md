## Cybersecurity intern @ Prodigy Infotech

This repository contains four projects showcasing various programming concepts and techniques. Below is an overview of each project and instructions on how to use them.

## Projects

1. [Caesar Cipher](#1-caesar-cipher)
2. [Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption](#2-pixel-manipulation-for-image-encryption)
3. [Keylogger.py](#3-keyloggerpy)
4. [PasswordCheck.html](#4-passwordcheckhtml)


### 1. Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This project demonstrates the implementation of the Caesar Cipher in Python.

#### Features
- Encryption and Decryption
- Customizable shift value
